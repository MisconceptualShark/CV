\lettersection{About Me}
I am currently a fourth year student at the University of Durham studying MPhys in Theoretical Physics. 
I have spent the previous years focusing on particle physics, through studying courses such as Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Gauge Field Theories, and Nuclear and Particle Physics. 
During my third year, I began looking into the difficulties of understanding and predicting the behaviours of QCD in a project to model the inter-quark potential in quarkonia systems.
My Masters thesis is still in progress, but in the preliminary stages, I have been testing the Two Higgs Doublet Model of Type II against flavour observables, finding constraints on its parameters. 
Through these courses and projects, I have developed a strong interest in the field of particle physics, flavour physics in particular. 
I am a very hard-working individual who will bring passion to my work and happily dedicate myself to my studies to the full extent of my abilities. 


\lettersection{Why the \research?}
I believe the \research would be a great place for me to continue my studies.
%---NIERSTE, STEINHAUSER, TUM AND BERN----
%-----------FELDMANN AND MANNEL-----------
The group's work in flavour physics and new physics extensions beyond the Standard Model aligns closely with what I have explored through my Masters program, and I have found great interest reading some of your publications, such as the frequent work on B physics and CP-violating processes.
The strong resources of \uni and frequent collaborations with other institutes across \country and the rest of the world would provide me with a great base to develop my skills and work alongside some of the best experts in the world of flavour phenomena. 
%-------------KARLSRUHE MILADA------------
%The group's work in Higgs physics and extensions beyond the Standard Model aligns closely with what I have explored through my Masters program, and I have found great interest reading some of your publications, such as probing Two Higgs Doublet Models and NMSSM Higgs masses.
%The strong resources of \uni and frequent collaborations with other institutes across \country and the rest of the world would provide me with a great base to develop my skills and work alongside some of the best experts in the world of Higgs physics. 
%-----------------------------------------
I believe I could prove to be a great addition to the team at the \research and would very much enjoy the opportunity to take my next steps in physics with you. 

\lettersection{Why Me?}
As I learn more and more about the mysteries of physics, there is one thing I can say with certainty: I need to know more. 
I know that what I have learned so far is but the tip of the iceberg, and I am so eager to continue my learning. 
I am a hard-working, dedicated student who is ready and willing to begin the intensive study and research of a PhD course and bring the strong communication skills and enjoyment of collaborative work that are very important to academic research. 
Critical thinking is another important aspect which is crucial in understanding fundamental physics for what is really being told; this critical thinking is a skill I have used across many disciplines of my life and will apply this skill to all my future pursuits in science.
The opportunity to continue my studies and begin to contribute towards the expansion of scientific knowledge would be something most valuable to me, and I would relish the chance to dedicate myself fully to this through a PhD position at the \research. 

\end{cvletter}
%There is something so fascinating about the formulation of the theory of particle physics, I cannot help but be drawn to it. 
%Over my undergraduate course, I have honed my programming skills for computational physics, such that I am now very comfortable creating programs to solve problems and perform lengthy calculations.
%As a test of my comfort in computational methods, I have volunteered throughout my fourth year as a demonstrator in the first year programming workshops where I help teach the incoming students the basics in the Python language for use in physics. 
%Science is a process and it is important as part of that to be able to pass on knowledge to the next generation, not only to allow them to advance too, but also to solidify our understanding of the concepts we are trying to share.
